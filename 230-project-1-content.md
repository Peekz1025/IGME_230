# Escape from Bullet Hell

## High Concept

## Genre
This is a bullet-hell game where you have to stay alive as the boss shoots a barrage of bullets at you.

## Platform
This will be a Desktop only game.

## Story
You are a soul lost in hell trying to escape.  You must fight against Satan and his henchmen to in order to escape your demise.

## Esthetics
Graphics style - simple and cartoonish
Souond - 8-bit looped track.  Sound effects will occur when the player spawns in, dies, and knocks out the boss.

## Gameplay
#### Mechanics
The player can dodge the bosses attacks as well as shoot back.  There is a meter showing how much ammunition you have left.  It will refile with time. The bullets will auto-aim at the boss.

#### Controls
The player will use the mouse to move around the arena and the left mouse button to shoot.

#### Teaching the Game
The game will be pretty simple to control so there will be a controls screen, but no tutorial.

#### Player Learning
The player will have to allocate their bullet amount properly so as not to run out when it's nessisary.  The player will also have to learn the bosses attack patterns to effectively dodge their attacks.  Certain bullets could also have different effects on the bosses and have different attack patterns, so you have to figure out which bullets are most effective against each boss.
